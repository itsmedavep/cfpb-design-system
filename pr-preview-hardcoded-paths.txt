When viewing the contrast checker, you’ll see that normal size text needs a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 and large text needs a contrast ratio of at least 3.1 to pass accessibility.

  29:   Consider the unintended consequences of your recruitment approach. For example, recruiting via personal networks can lead to hearing only from people who share similar characteristics, experiences, or beliefs as yourself. Ask yourself whether these people are authentic representatives of the people who will ultimately use your product. Similarly, recruiting via social media can omit people who don’t have internet access at all. These issues are known as [sampling bias](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/guidelines/conducting-research#be-aware-of-how-bias-can-show-up-during-research).      
  63:   [The frames of reference activity](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/guidelines/setting-the-foundation#frames-of-reference) can help you and your team think more broadly about different identities and communities to include in your research.  
  136:   Collect, record, and share only the bare minimum of information needed to accomplish the goals of your research, and carefully safeguard that information. See the [section below on data handling](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/guidelines/conducting-research#handle-data-and-stories-with-care) for more information.   
  145:   Anticipate sensitive questions or topics as best you can, and [look for signs of trauma](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/guidelines/conducting-research#recognize-and-respond-to-trauma-in-participants). Be prepared to ask your participant if they’d be willing to talk about a topic, and if they’re not, move on, or end the research activity as needed. Note that even if the participant chooses to end research sessions early, they should still be paid for their time.    
  151:   As part of beginning the project for which you’re conducting research, your team should have spent time [uncovering biases](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/guidelines/setting-the-foundation#identify-lived-experiences-and-biases) using exercises such as [frames of reference](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/guidelines/setting-the-foundation#frames-of-reference). If you have not taken those steps yet, consider doing them before conducting research activities. 
  227:   Realize the impact that trauma has had on individuals and their interactions with people and institutions. Identify historical oppression and policies that have negatively impacted specific groups. If you haven’t already taken the time to learn how [power structures can affect the people you serve](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/guidelines/setting-the-foundation#learn-how-power-structures-can-affect-the-people-you-serve), now would be a good time to do so.

  93:   Consider the [hazards and harms](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/guidelines/design-and-development#hazard-mapping) that could occur as a result of your work. In particular, look out for any representations that might unintentionally perpetuate racial profiling or stereotypes, enshrined status quo and power structures, and systemic bias.

docs/pages/design-tokens.md
  24:   Our legacy component versions—currently found in the "Components" sub section of [Components](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/components/)—leverage SCSS mixins, variables, etc., in the form of `$varible-name: value` or `--variable-name: value`. We've used this approach for several years, and it has served us well as it delivers a familiar developer experience. However, this approach requires knowledge of SCSS, is tied to the platform, and is extensive. 
  30:   We've started creating web component versions of our legacy components. These can be found on the [Elements](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/components/elements) page within the "Web components (beta)" sub section of [Components](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/components/). These web components utilize design tokens for color values in the form of platform-agnostic JSON. Style Dictionary translates this JSON into .css custom properties. These tokens become easily parsed and consumed, meaning we could deliver them into Android or iOS formats if desired.

docs/pages/e-mail-signup-forms.md
  87:   The most common placement for the email signup form is in the sidebar. This placement is possible on [Learn](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/pages/learn-pages) and [Sublanding](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/pages/sublanding-pages) pages. Because [Browse](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/pages/browse-pages) pages do not have a sidebar, the email signup form can be placed in the prefooter at the bottom of the page.
  93:   An inset email signup form appears in the main content area of a page and is possible on [Learn](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/pages/learn-pages) and [Sublanding](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/pages/sublanding-pages) pages. Consider using an inset email signup form when the email call to action (CTA) is more important to the purpose of the page than the sidebar or prefooter placement reflects. When using an inset email signup form, ensure its placement on the page does not interfere with the primary page goal. Users respond better to follow-on requests that happen after their primary goal has been met.

  659:   The [cfpb-icons](https://github.com/cfpb/design-system/tree/main/packages/cfpb-design-system/src/components/cfpb-icons/icons) component provides Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) icons. The filenames of the SVGs included with cfpb-icons match the names in the [icon library](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/foundation/iconography#icon-library-1) section. We encourage using your templating system to inject the SVG icon files, as opposed to copying and pasting the raw SVG.
  668:   If you look in [cfpb-icons.scss](https://github.com/cfpb/design-system/blob/main/packages/cfpb-design-system/src/components/cfpb-icons/src/cfpb-icons.scss) you can see that we have encoded `class="cf-icon-svg"` in the root element of each of our SVG icons. As a result, the CSS rule gets applied to all of the SVGs on the page, just like any other HTML element.
  682:   Please reference the [Links](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/components/links#links-with-icons) page for guidance regarding icons paired with links.

  51:   An image’s dimensions can also impact what’s possible. If the image appears in the [hero pattern](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/patterns/heroes), text will sit on top of it and need to be readable across breakpoints. If the image accompanies body copy in an [info unit group](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/patterns/info-unit-groups), it will have limited space.  
  89:   | **Natural interaction** <br/>If the photo shows people, their body language and facial expressions feel natural and not staged.                                                                                                           | ![Consumers discussing a financial decision](/design-system/images/uploads/photography_editorial_example_3.png)                                                                 |
  91:   | **Authentic atmosphere** <br/>The photo’s atmosphere feels warm, relatable, and like you’re glimpsing into a real scenario.                                                                                                               | ![Consumer taking a financial action](/design-system/images/uploads/tone_example_2.png)                                                                                         |
  93:   | **Inclusive** <br/>When photographing or choosing images, consider skin color, age, gender identity, income level, and range of ability. Be inclusive and representative of the American public. Be mindful not to reinforce stereotypes. | ![Consumer taking a financial action](/design-system/images/uploads/tone_example_3.jpg) ![Consumer taking a financial action](/design-system/images/uploads/tone_example_4.jpg) |
  95:   | **Feeling of being in control** <br/>When showing a person accomplishing a task, the composition feels organized and actionable.                                                                                                          | ![Consumer taking a financial action](/design-system/images/uploads/tone_example_5.png)                                                                                         |
  109:   Illustration can help explain complex processes. Illustration also has the ability to be socially and politically neutral. Visit the [Illustration page](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/foundation/illustration) for more guidance. 

docs/pages/print-styles.md
  25:   URLs for links, buttons, and videos display when printed. This ensures a user can access the linked content if desired. Visit  [Links](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/components/links) and [Buttons](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/components/buttons) for specifications.  
  31:   Patterns such as [info unit groups](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/patterns/info-unit-groups) and [featured content modules](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/patterns/featured-content-module) print in their large-screen layouts. Printing patterns in this format enables multi-column layouts with readable line lengths and reasonably sized images.  
  43:   For pages with single-column layouts, column width is reduced when printed to ensure readable line lengths on paper. Whereas as a reader may have control over aspects such as browser width and text size in a digital setting, they do not have this control when reading a printed piece, so it’s important that line lengths are as readable as possible. See the section "Line lengths" on the [Fonts](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/foundation/fonts) page for more information.
